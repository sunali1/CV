A recent Makers Academy graduate, I am a Full Stack Junior Developer. I am an
enthusiastic and motivated coder with a great attitude.

I am looking for a junior developer role. I would like to work in a challenging
and nurturing environment where I can continuously learn and hone my TDD skills.

#### Problem-Solving and Resourceful

I have always been curious about how things worked, taking things/problems apart to see how an existing solution works (reverse-engineering). I am fascinated by computers, technology and coding and love solving coding problems.
I am a voracious and speedy reader which makes it easy to learn and find solutions.
* At Makers Academy, my final team project was a game development, a completely new coding territory and we were unsure which tech-stack would be best. I read about and tried various tech stacks and by day two presented to the rest of the team the technologies to use, then researched to find the best tutorial to use for the team.
* In my previous role in the recruitment company, I taught myself and setup the IT infrastructure, including setting up servers, networks, email accounts for users, cyber-security, internal messaging system.

#### Understand how business side of things work.

* Founded a headhunting company with a partner, managed all the business operations side of things. Accounts, Invoicing, Budgets. IT infrastructure.
* Setting up a recruitment specific CRM.
